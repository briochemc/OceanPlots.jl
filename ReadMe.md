# OceanPlots

OceanPlots.jl aims to provide tools to generate figures from output of the [AIBECS](https://github.com/briochemc/AIBECS.jl) (a marine tracer modelling system).

This package should be regularly filled with new routines as I (and others?) create new plots, so that it should remain in constant development. 

The package will be organized into mainly two different purposes:
- exploration (i.e., not too pretty but quick and with, e.g., interactivity)
- publication (pretty, flawless, vectorized, quality figures)
